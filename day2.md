# Day 2

## Setup

1. Install Sublime-Text
	
	**Ubuntu**
	
	* http://tipsonubuntu.com/2017/05/30/install-sublime-text-3-ubuntu-16-04-official-way/
	
	**Mac**
	
	```
	brew cask install sublime-text
	```

2. Lets make sure we all have the same python setup.

	Run `which python2`.	If this returns something like `/usr/local/bin/python2` on macOS or `/usr/bin/python2` on Ubuntu, then you don't need to do anything. If it returns nothing, run the following command to standardize your python setup with mine.
	
	**Mac**

	`brew install python`
	
	**Ubuntu**

	`sudo apt-get install python python-pip`
