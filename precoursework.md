# Pre Course Work

DPI-691M: Programming and Data for Policymakers

Welcome to "Programming and Data for Policymakers". I'm Dhrumil Mehta, your course instructor. I'm looking forward to meeting and working with everyone in January.

Since we only have a short time together in class, I have prepared some pre-work that can help us get a running start and get some logistics out of the way. Please make sure to complete the items in this todo list below before the first day of class.

## To Do

* Fill out the [pre-course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSCZS-Hs4oD6yvFxUipPiEVmNv-dCM5RuZKsqKdLXWII9ZZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you haven't already.
* Join Slack. You should have recieved an invitation via email to join the slack team. We will use slack to communicate during the course. I will be available on Slack at least a few times a week until the course to answer any questions you might have with the pre-work. If you have not received the email invite, please email me.
* Do first five lessons of the CodeCademy Python Tutorial [[Lesson 1-5](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)]
	- This may take a few hours to complete, so it will be best to get started sooner rather than later. Knowing programming **is not** a prerequisite for this course, but having experience with some of the basic concepts will help things move a little more smoothly. Please set aside some time to complete the first five lessons of this tutorial before coming to class. **I would recommend at a minimum you do just the first lesson within each section**, but if you want a more thorough understanding, you can go beyond that. 
	- Following these tutorials will be especially important if you haven't written code before. We will be covering the concepts you need to know in class without assuming prior knowledge, but these exersices will help you to build muscle memory of writing code (not mis-spelling commands, closing brackets you open, being able to read pseudo-code) as well as some basic concepts (variables, lists, strings, logic) which it will be easier to learn during class if you've encountered them before.
	- You don't have to purchase a "pro" subscription (which unlocks quizzes in the lesson). If you think the quizzes will help you better understand the content, feel free to get a one month subscription. I won't be looking at or grading the quizzes though, they are purely optional.
* Think about the project - This course is focused around building a project that includes visualizing a dataset. Please be thinking of data in an area of your interest that you might want to use in your project.

### Additional Instructions for Windows Users

This course will require us to use a Unix shell which is included in the Linux and Mac operating systems. Since it can be hard to debug many different computers with different configurations, I ask that all Windows users please come with Ubuntu installed. There are a few different options for installing Ubuntu, please see the guide here: [windows.md](windows.md)

## Optional Readings
The suggested pre-readings for the course are on the topics of scrum and agile software development. During the course, we will discuss the benefits of agile and its adoption in delivering government services. We will also experiment with adopting some of the principles of "scrum", one of many agile and iterative software development strategies, to our learning over the course of the week of in-class instruction and into the project.

* SCRUM: A Breathtaking Brief and Agile Introduction - Chris sims and Hillary Louise Johnson] [[~20 minute read](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Breathtakingly-Brief-Agile-Introduction/dp/193796504X)]
* The Agile Manifesto [[~1 minute read](http://agilemanifesto.org/)]
* Elements of Scrum [[full book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O0U74Q/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&psc=1)]	- This reading is very optional. I would recommend the first four chapters through "Agile Values and Principles". If you're interested in knowing more about scrum though, feel free to read on and learn through google and/or youtube videos.

The kindle editions of these books are cheaper and can be read electronically on your browser through the [kindle cloud reader](https://read.amazon.com/) even if you don't own a kindle.
