## Forking

Draw on the board, forking vs branching

### Key Terms

* **fork** - make a copy of a remote repo on github.
* **merge**  - taking two histories, merge one into the other
* **push**   - sending changes to a remote repository and merging them into the specified branch
* **pull request** - ask the upstream maintainer to pull in changes from origin.
* **merge conflict** - when two commits conflict, and thus can't be merged automatically

## Pull requests from a fork

Pull Request (From a Fork)

https://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms/pull/538

## Try It (together)

1. Find another partner, and fork their simple webpage into your github.
2. Clone your fork onto your local computer
3. Put an endorsement on their webpage as the last item on the site.

	```
	<h2> Endorsements </h2>
	
	<p> You are a really cool person. - Dhrumil</p>
	```
4. commit this endorsement and push it to your fork in github
5. issue a pull request back to that person's github repo

## Try It

Put an endorsement on someone else's site using the same method, forking and open source collaboration.

## Finally

1. Create a "github page" for yourself [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) - follow the instructions for a "User"
2. Chose Jekyll Theme to instantly make it look good

2. (optional) - buy a domain for yourself at [http://namecheap.com](http://namecheap.com). When we get to the "DevOps" lesson, you'll learn how to connect your new domain to either a static or dynamic webpage.
