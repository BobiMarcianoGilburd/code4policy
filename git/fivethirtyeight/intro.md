Git versus GitHub: 

* Git is a distributed version control system. It is a technology.

* GitHub is a social coding platform where git repositories are stored and where people can collaborate on projects. GitHub is great both for collaboration within your organization, but also provides an excellent model for open source collaboration across organizations or with the public. We do both of these here at FiveThirtyEight.

On **GitHub** you can find **Git** repositories.
