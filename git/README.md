# Git & GitHub

- setup/install
- conceptual intro to git and github
- setup ssh keys (with a short aside about security and SSH)
- simple workflow - master branch, add, commit, push, pull
	- we'll make a small, simple html & css webpage as we do it
- branching workflow
	- working collaboratively on one webpage (in your project groups - this is a dummy webpage, not the project itself) 
- Forking and Open Source Collaboration
- If we have time, jekyll-based GitHub page (for personal fun use)
