## Agile Manifesto

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

<!-- Agile Activity -->
<!--
Split up into 4 teams
- 5-10 minutes of research on your topic (silent?)
- 5 minutes of discussion about how that might apply to the course
- Share that with the rest of the class

## Scrum-ified (Scrum-ish?) Class

1) Define product owner and scrum master (one for today, two for remaining days)

2) Sprint Planning (we'll save this for the project)

3) Come up with user stories

* 2 as yourself
* 1 as other "users" (in our case stakeholders)

4) Come up with a definition of "Done" on the back of each card

## Agile in Government
(Well, specifically the US Government)

Still nacent, but gaining momemtum. Like a baby holding onto the railing and learning to walk. -
[David Zvenyach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdavez) (Executive
Director of 18F)

### Waterfall in Government

Much of government traditionally operates in the waterfall style.

Policy --> Requirements Gathering/Design --> Procurement/Contracts/etc --> Development --> Pres release
