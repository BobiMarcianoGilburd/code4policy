### Waterfall vs Iterative Development

### Agile is Cyclical

### Agile Manifesto

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

### Agile Principles
[12 principles](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/)

### An Agile J-Term
Split up into 4 teams:

- 5 minutes of research on your topic
- 10 minutes of discussion about how that might apply to the course
- share that with the rest of the class

### Agile in Government
(Well, specifically the US Government)

Much of government traditionally operates in the waterfall style.

> Policy -->
> Requirements Gathering/Design -->
> Procurement/Contracts/etc -->
> Development -->
> Press release

Some agencies are pushing for more agile development.

Its still nacent, but gaining momemtum. Like a baby holding onto the railing and learning to walk. -

## Scrum

A toolset for Agile Software Development

### Roles

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Team Member

### Meetings / Ceremonies

- Sprint Planning
	- What will we do?
		- Product owner proposes user stories to tackle
		- Team decides on which stories they'll commit to in this sprint
	- How will we do it?
		- User stories split up into tasks
		- Tasks are placed in sprint backlog
- Daily Scrum
	- Daily, max 15 mins
	- 3 simple questions
		- What have you been working on since the last meeting?
		- What are you working on between now and the next meeting?
		- What are your blockers?
- Story Time
	- "Grooming" your backlog
	- Stories "values" for burndown decided upon (planning poker)
	- Larger, abstract, further away stories are split and hashed out
	- Acceptance criteria are defined and refined
- Sprint Review
	- Demonstrate the stories that got done during the sprint to all stakeholders
- Retrospective
	- Identify 1 or 2 strategic changes for the next sprint, quick + and Î”

### Artifacts

- Product Backlog (List of User Stories)
- Sprint Backlog
- Task Board (trello)
	- ICEBOX, TODO, DOING, BLOCKED, DONE
	- can customize based on your definition of done (multiple stages of done?)
- Burn Chart
- Definition of Done

### Scrum Teams

* Small (7 +/- 2)
* Cross Functional
* Self Organizing

### A Scrum-ified (Scrum-ish?) J-term

1. Define product owner and scrum master (one for today, two for remaining days)
2. Come up with user stories

	http://agileforall.com/new-to-agile-invest-in-good-user-stories/

	* 2 as yourself
	* 1 as other "users" (in our case stakeholders)

3. Come up with a definition of "Done" on the back of each card
