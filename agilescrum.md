### Agile Manifesto

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

### Agile Principles
[12 principles](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/)

### An Agile J-Term
Split up into 4 teams:
	
- 5 minutes of research on your topic
- 10 minutes of discussion about how that might apply to the course
- share that with the rest of the class

### Agile in Government
(Well, specifically the US Government)

Much of government traditionally operates in the waterfall style.

> Policy --> 
> Requirements Gathering/Design --> 
> Procurement/Contracts/etc --> 
> Development --> 
> Press release

Some agencies are pushing for more agile development.

Agile is still nacent, but gaining momemtum. Like a baby holding onto the railing and learning to walk. -

1. Define product owner and scrum master (one for today, two for remaining days)
2. Come up with user stories

	http://agileforall.com/new-to-agile-invest-in-good-user-stories/
	
	* 2 as yourself
	* 1 as other "users" (in our case stakeholders)

3. Come up with a definition of "Done" on the back of each card
